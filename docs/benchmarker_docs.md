# Yeast Proteome Benchmarker

## Overview

The **Yeast Proteome Benchmarker** is a Python-based tool that benchmarks the performance of a coding sequence (CDS) optimization pipeline against the yeast proteome. This tool is adapted from the **Transcript Designer** project and serves as a validation tool to evaluate how well optimized CDS sequences conform to yeast-specific constraints.

The benchmarker not only validates sequences but also parses the optimization summaries to track validation failures. This process helped improve the CDS optimizer while simultaneously enhancing my debugging and analytical skills.

## Important Note

The benchmarker at the end throws a biopython warning for one codon sequence not being a multiple of 3. However, it was able to pass my multiple of 3 check during validation and all properly translated (except for 1 that did not start with M). I believe its a non-issue, but
it is important to note.

## Key Functionalities

### **1. Parsing Optimization Summaries**
The benchmarker parses the constraint summaries produced by **DNA Chisel** to:
- Identify **validation failures** (e.g., GC content violations, forbidden patterns, rare codons, or hairpin formations).
- Track failure points for further debugging and improvement.

This summary parsing allows precise tracking of optimization issues.

### **2. Benchmarking Against the Yeast Proteome**
The benchmarker:
- Takes protein sequences from the yeast proteome (e.g., obtained from UniProt).
- Uses the **Transcript Designer** pipeline to optimize each protein sequence into a yeast-compatible CDS.
- Validates each optimized CDS and records failures.

This benchmarking process ensures that the optimizer performs robustly across real biological datasets.

## Code Components

### **1. Benchmarking Pipeline**
The main method benchmarks protein sequences by running them through the optimizer and validating the results.

### **2. Parsing Validation Failures**
The benchmarker extracts key information about failures (e.g., GC content violations, forbidden sequences, or hairpins) from the optimization summaries.

### **3. Generating Reports**
The benchmarker outputs a report summarizing all validation failures, making it easy to debug and refine the optimizer.

## Key Learnings and Challenges
### 1. Adapting the Optimizer
Adapting the Transcript Designer to benchmark against the yeast proteome required:

- Understanding how to process and handle large datasets (e.g., yeast protein sequences from UniProt).
- Integrating and automating the optimizer for large-scale benchmarking.

## 2. Parsing Optimization Summaries
I learned how to parse complex summaries generated by DNA Chisel to extract meaningful information:

- Tracking forbidden patterns, hairpin formations, and GC content violations.
- Organizing failures into clear, actionable reports.
- This helped me identify patterns in failures and debug the optimizer more efficiently.

## 3. Debugging and Error Handling
Creating the benchmarker was an exercise in debugging. I improved my ability to:

- Pinpoint issues in the optimizer pipeline.
- Systematically test and validate components.
- Use regular expressions to extract details from large textual outputs.

## Conclusion
Developing the Yeast Proteome Benchmarker not only validated the performance of the CDS optimizer but also significantly improved my understanding of:

- Yeast-specific constraints and optimization challenges.
- How to systematically parse and analyze optimization outputs.
- Debugging tools and techniques when working with external libraries.
